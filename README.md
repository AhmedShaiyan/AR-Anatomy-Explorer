# AR Pathology Explorer

**Real-time AR guidance for pathology specimen grossing and surgical planning**

## üî¨ Project Description

The AR Pathology Assistant is an innovative web-based augmented reality application designed to revolutionize pathology specimen processing. It provides real-time visual guidance to pathology assistants during the critical "grossing" stage, where physical specimens (organs, tissues) are manually cut to prepare them for microscopic examination.

### The Problem
Pathology assistants often rely on CT scans and radiology images as references when cutting specimens, but translating 2D digital slices to 3D physical objects is:
- **Time-consuming** (10+ minutes of mental 3D mapping)
- **Error-prone** (missed diagnoses due to incorrect cuts)
- **Challenging for training** junior staff

### Our Solution
- **AI-powered registration** aligns digital models with physical specimens
- **AR visualization** shows optimal cutting planes directly on the specimen
- **Real-time guidance** for lesion sampling with safety margins
- **Web-based platform** accessible on any mobile device

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Manual Hologram Positioning** - Intuitive touch controls for precise alignment
- **AI Registration System** - Automatic specimen recognition and orientation optimization
- **Cutting Plane Visualization** - Color-coded surgical guidance with safety margins
- **Lesion Targeting** - Optimal sampling angles for diagnostic accuracy
- **Mobile-First Design** - Works on smartphones and tablets
- **Real-Time AR** - No additional hardware required

## üõ† Technologies Used
